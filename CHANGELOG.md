## [3.4.2] - 2026-04-29

### Design polish & consistency pass

A focused pass on header chrome, sidebar navigation, cards, and the Security page. Several long-standing visual inconsistencies and a Bootstrap collapse init bug were fixed along the way.

### 🎨 Header & sidebar refresh

- **Ghost icon buttons in the header** — theme, fullscreen, notifications, and user-menu buttons no longer use bordered `btn-outline-secondary`; they're now borderless square icon buttons with a subtle filled hover state. Override scoped to `.admin-header .navbar-nav .btn` so all 21 pages pick it up via the shared layout SCSS — no per-page markup edits needed.
- **Softer "⌘K"-style search input** — tertiary-bg fill, no visible border at rest, soft `primary-border-subtle` focus ring. Less visual weight than the previous hard-bordered field.
- **Thin divider before the user menu** — clean visual separation between system controls and the account menu.
- **Trimmed `.navbar-brand`** — slightly smaller "Metis" wordmark with tighter letter-spacing.
- **Sidebar: dropped the `translateX(4px)` hover lift** on top-level and submenu items — a 2018-feeling effect that didn't add usability.
- **Active sidebar state redesigned** — was a heavy solid-primary fill across the whole row; now uses a subtle `primary-bg-subtle` background plus a 3px primary accent bar pinned to the sidebar's left edge via `::before`. The accent bar is scoped to top-level items only (submenus get a slightly stronger fill instead). Section header ("Admin" caps) restyled with smaller font and tighter letter-spacing.

### 🃏 Cards — consistent design across the template

- **Global `.card` style unified** with the previously-separate `.element-card` look from the elements overview page. Cards now have a 1px `--bs-border-color` border, `0.75rem` corners, and a subtle `--bs-box-shadow-sm` at rest. Hover lifts the card with a softer `0 6px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` shadow (border color stays neutral on hover for a subtler interaction).
- **Removed leftover glassmorphism** — `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` and the `inset 0 1px 0 rgba(...)` faux-highlight are gone. They served no purpose on opaque cards.
- **Removed conflicting `.stats-card { border: none; ... }` override** in `_tables.scss` that was making the dashboard's top stats row look different from every other card on the site. Kept only the `.stats-icon` sizing block, which is the part actually specific to stats cards.
- **`.card-header` / `.card-footer` get internal 1px borders** so divisions render crisply against the new bordered card.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- **Elements submenu flash on every page load** — `main.js` was calling `new Collapse(element)` without config, so Bootstrap's default `toggle: true` immediately toggled each collapse target on construction. The Elements submenu was briefly auto-opening with a `.collapsing` height transition on every navigation. Fixed by passing `{ toggle: false }`, matching what Bootstrap's own data-API uses internally.
- **Notifications dropdown missing on 7 element sub-pages** — `elements-alerts`, `elements-badges`, `elements-buttons`, `elements-cards`, `elements-forms`, `elements-modals`, and `elements-tables` had a stripped-down header that lacked the bell icon entirely (also missing the user-menu chevron, button tooltips, and the responsive `d-none d-md-inline-block` on fullscreen). All 7 were verified byte-identical and bulk-replaced with the canonical header from `index.html`. All 21 pages now share the exact same header markup.
- **Security page styles were broken in multiple ways** —
  - `.security-item` and `.security-info` had no styles at all → the Account / Two-Factor / Privacy sections rendered as a wall of plain text. Added the same flex-row pattern used by Settings (title + description on left, control on right, divider between rows).
  - `.security-status` was styled as a full-width banner block but used as a small inline "Enabled / Disabled" label → rebuilt as a pill badge with `.enabled` (green) / `.disabled` (grey) variants.
  - `.session-item` styles were nested under a non-existent `.session-management` wrapper and never applied → unscoped.
  - `.activity-item` styles were nested under a non-existent `.activity-log` wrapper → unscoped.
  - `.activity-icon` color variants used class names (`.login`, `.logout`, `.security`, `.error`) that the runtime binding never produced (binding was `activity.type` which yields `.login_success`, `.password_change`, etc.) → switched binding to `activity.severity` and aligned variants to `.success` / `.info` / `.warning` / `.danger`.
  - Page-header buttons (`viewSecurityLog`, `emergencyLockdown`) were rendered *outside* the `x-data="securityComponent"` block → clicks silently failed. Moved `x-data` up to the `container-fluid` wrapper.
  - Activity rows referenced `activity.title` / `activity.description`, but the Alpine data only has `message` / `details` → text wasn't rendering. Bindings corrected.

### 🧹 Markup cleanup

- **Removed redundant "Active" badge from sidebar Security row** across all 11 pages where it appeared (`<span class="badge bg-primary rounded-pill ms-auto">Active</span>`). The active state is now communicated through the new accent bar + filled background — the badge was decorative duplication.

---

## [3.4.1] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **Search shortcut now Mac-aware** — placeholders said `Ctrl+K` on every page; the keydown handler already accepted both `Ctrl` and `Cmd`, but Mac users naturally tried `⌘K` (which the placeholder didn't advertise) and assumed it was broken. Placeholders are now rewritten to `⌘K` at runtime on macOS, and the handler also matches `event.code === 'KeyK'` (layout-independent) while explicitly excluding `Alt`/`Shift` so combinations like Cmd+Shift+K (DevTools console) don't accidentally trigger search focus.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-04-28

### Hardening Pass — Security, Accessibility, Performance & Maintenance

A wide-ranging audit-driven release that tightens the template across security, accessibility, performance, and code quality. No public-API or markup-structure breaks; existing pages keep working as-is.

### 📦 Dependency Updates

Major upgrades across the build toolchain, plus two runtime dependencies removed.

- **Vite** 7.3.1 → **8.0.10** (major) — switched to the new rolldown-based bundler; `manualChunks` updated to function form
- **@vitejs/plugin-legacy** 7.2.1 → **8.0.1** (major)
- **ESLint** 9.39.2 → **10.2.1** (major)
- **@eslint/js** 9.39.2 → **10.0.1** (major)
- **globals** 16.2.0 → **17.5.0** (major)
- **Lucide** 0.469.0 → **1.11.0** (major) — packaging bug from the prior rollback is fixed upstream
- **Alpine.js** 3.15.4 → **3.15.11**
- **ApexCharts** 5.3.6 → **5.10.6**
- **SweetAlert2** 11.26.17 → **11.26.24**
- **dayjs** 1.11.19 → **1.11.20**
- **Sass** 1.97.3 → **1.99.0**
- **PostCSS** 8.5.6 → **8.5.12**
- **Autoprefixer** 10.4.23 → **10.5.0**
- **Prettier** 3.8.1 → **3.8.3**
- **rimraf** 6.1.2 → **6.1.3**
- **Removed `chart.js`** — dashboard migrated to ApexCharts; one chart library is enough (saved ~63 KB gzip in `vendor-charts`)
- **Removed `@fortawesome/fontawesome-free`** — never imported in source; Bootstrap Icons is the only icon font in use

### 🔒 Security

- **Replaced unsafe `innerHTML` interpolation** in `notifications.js` (toast renderer + activity feed) and `dashboard.js` (recent-orders table) with `createElement` + `textContent`. The dangerous `onclick="${config.action.handler}"` pattern is gone — toast actions must now be passed as functions.
- **Replaced inline `onclick` attributes** in `elements-tables.html` with `data-*` attributes + delegated listeners; also fixed a pre-existing JS syntax error in that page's inline script.
- **Added security meta tags** to all 21 HTML pages: `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.
- **Whitelisted `localStorage` schema validation** in `security.js` and `settings.js` — corrupt or unexpected entries are removed instead of silently merged into component state.
- **Added `autocomplete="new-password"`** to all password inputs in `forms.html` and `elements-forms.html`.
- **Production bundles strip `console.*` and `debugger`** via `esbuild.drop` in `vite.config.js`.

### ♿ Accessibility

- **Skip-to-main-content link** injected on all 21 pages, paired with `id="main-content"` on every `<main>` element.
- **Restored visible keyboard focus rings** — replaced `outline: none` (without replacement) in `_buttons.scss`, `_hamburger.scss`, `_products.scss`, and `_orders.scss` with `:focus-visible` rings using `var(--bs-primary)`.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` support** — new `_a11y.scss` partial that disables animations and transitions for users who opt out.
- **Sidebar toggle ARIA** — `[data-sidebar-toggle]` now has `aria-controls="admin-sidebar"` and a dynamic `aria-expanded` that reflects sidebar state on both desktop and mobile.
- **Sortable users table** — `<th>` elements got `role="button"`, `tabindex="0"`, keyboard handlers (Enter / Space), and dynamic `aria-sort` reflecting current sort.
- **Heading hierarchy normalized** —
  - Logo `<h1 class="h4">Metis</h1>` → `<span>` (it's branding, not a page heading) so each page has a single `<h1>`.
  - Card titles `<h5 class="card-title">` → `<h2 class="h5 card-title">` across all pages (visual size preserved via Bootstrap typography classes).
  - Stat-card values `<h3 x-text="stats.total">` → `<div class="h3" aria-live="polite"><span x-text=…>` (values aren't headings; `aria-live` so screen readers announce updates).
  - Stat-card labels `<h6>` → `<h3 class="h6">` (semantic h3, visual h6).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Memory leaks from uncleared timers/listeners** —
  - `dashboard.js`: rewrote with tracked `intervals`/`timeouts`/`cleanupFns` sets; `destroy()` clears them all.
  - `analytics.js`: tracked interval + a single replaceable resize handler; `destroy()` runs on `pagehide`.
  - `messages.js`: tracked simulated-activity intervals.
  - `main.js`: wired `app.destroy()` to a one-shot `pagehide` listener so the cleanup runs on real navigations.
- **Fixed missing dashboard charts** — `index.html` had three `<canvas>` containers left over from Chart.js; ApexCharts needs `<div>` containers and silently does nothing otherwise. Converted to `<div>` with appropriate `min-height`.
- **`bi-crown` mapping in `icon-manager.js`** pointed at a non-existent icon; remapped to `bi-award`.
- **Pre-existing inline-script syntax error** in `elements-tables.html` (orphaned `}` and `});` from a previous removal) cleaned up as part of the inline-onclick refactor.

### ⚡ Performance

- **CSS bundle: 499 KB → 399 KB raw (-100 KB / -20%)** —
  - Removed unused Bootstrap component partials from `main.scss`: `accordion`, `carousel`, `offcanvas`, `popover`, `placeholders` (audit confirmed zero markup usage).
  - Generated `_bootstrap-icons-subset.scss` containing only the **158 icons** actually referenced in the project, replacing the full Bootstrap Icons CSS (was 2,078 rules).
  - Added `~bootstrap-icons` Vite alias so the subset's `@font-face` resolves into `node_modules`.
- **Vite build hardening** — added `target: 'es2020'`, `cssCodeSplit: true`, `cssMinify: 'lightningcss'`, explicit `minify: true`, `chunkSizeWarningLimit: 600`.
- **Production console stripping** — `esbuild.drop: ['console', 'debugger']` removes ~16 of 17 `console.log`s from the built `main.js`.
- **Vendor chunks** — dropped `Offcanvas` and `Popover` from the Bootstrap JS imports (zero usage in markup), reducing the `vendor-bootstrap` chunk slightly.

### 🛠️ Code Quality

- **Extracted `searchComponent` factory** — `utils/search-component.js` exports `createSearchComponent({ getResults, minLength, delayMs })`. Replaced 11 nearly-identical Alpine `searchComponent` definitions across `users.js`, `elements.js`, `calendar.js`, `files.js`, `help.js`, `messages.js`, `orders.js`, `products.js`, `reports.js`, `security.js`, and `settings.js`.
- **Constants module** — new `utils/constants.js` hoists scattered timing values: `MOBILE_BREAKPOINT_PX`, `RESIZE_DEBOUNCE_MS`, `REALTIME_FAST_POLL_MS`, `REALTIME_DASHBOARD_POLL_MS`, `STAT_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS`, etc. Wired into `sidebar.js`, `dashboard.js`, `messages.js`, and `analytics.js`.
- **Stricter ESLint** — added `eqeqeq: 'smart'`, `prefer-const`, `no-var`. Surfaced and fixed two latent issues (a `let` that should be `const`, a `==` comparison).
- **Removed abandoned `complete-cleanup.sh`** dev script (had a hardcoded path to the maintainer's iCloud).
- **Build artifacts no longer tracked** — uncommented `dist-modern/` (and `dist/`) in `.gitignore`; ran `git rm -r --cached dist-modern/` to untrack 51 stale build files. No more rebuild-churn diffs in PRs.

### 📝 Notes

- **0 vulnerabilities** — `npm audit` clean across all production and dev dependencies.
- **Font file subsetting deferred** — `bootstrap-icons.woff2` (134 KB) and `.woff` (180 KB) still ship the full glyph set. Subsetting requires `pyftsubset` / `glyphhanger` and would shrink to ~15-20 KB. Open task for a follow-up release.
- **Migration note for downstream consumers** — if you customized `dashboard.js` to use Chart.js, you'll need to switch to ApexCharts (see `DEVELOPMENT.md` "Charts" section). Toast `action` callbacks must now be functions, not strings.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-01-26

### Responsive Layout Overhaul - Mobile & Sidebar Rework

Complete rework of the mobile experience and sidebar toggle system for a polished, production-ready responsive layout.

### Fixed

- **Mobile layout completely broken** - Sidebar, header, footer, and cards all had layout issues below the `lg` breakpoint
- **Sidebar never toggled on desktop** - `SidebarManager` module existed but was never imported or initialized in `main.js`
- **Duplicate sidebar toggle handlers** - Inline `<script>` blocks in all 21 HTML pages conflicted with `SidebarManager`, causing desktop toggle clicks to cancel out (both handlers fired, toggling the class on then off)
- **Dropdowns pushed layout on mobile** - Bootstrap's `navbar-expand-lg` sets `.dropdown-menu` to `position: static` below the `lg` breakpoint; forced to `position: absolute` for proper overlay behavior
- **Inconsistent mobile breakpoints** - Some components used 768px, others 991.98px; standardized to 991.98px (`lg`) throughout
- **Hamburger menu hidden behind logo** - Repositioned hamburger into the header navbar flow and pinned it at the sidebar edge on desktop

### Changed

- **Sidebar toggle architecture** - Single source of truth via `SidebarManager` module; removed all 21 inline sidebar toggle `<script>` blocks from HTML pages
- **Hamburger menu placement** - Moved from floating `position: fixed` element to header navbar; absolutely positioned at sidebar edge on desktop, normal flow on mobile
- **Mobile sidebar behavior** - Now uses off-screen `transform: translateX(-100%)` with overlay backdrop instead of broken margin/width toggling
- **Desktop sidebar collapse** - Clean mini-sidebar (70px) with hidden labels, badges, and submenus; content area adjusts via `margin-left` transition
- **Footer responsive** - Resets `margin-left` to 0 below `lg` breakpoint

### Added

- **`SidebarManager` initialization** - Imported and instantiated in `main.js` (was previously dead code)
- **Sidebar backdrop** - Added `.sidebar-backdrop` overlay element to all 21 HTML pages for mobile sidebar
- **Mobile sidebar features** - Escape key closes sidebar, backdrop click closes, body scroll lock when open, resize handler cleans up state when crossing breakpoints
- **Responsive card styles** - Smaller padding and icon sizes on mobile for stats cards
- **Compact header buttons** - Reduced button padding on small screens
- **Header dropdown fix** - `.navbar-nav .dropdown-menu { position: absolute }` override in `_header.scss`

1. **SCSS Variables** in `src-modern/styles/scss/abstracts/_variables.scss`
2. **Component Styles** in `src-modern/styles/scss/components/`
3. **JavaScript Components** in `src-modern/scripts/components/`
4. **Vite Configuration** in `vite.config.js`

### 📈 Breaking Changes

- **Node.js 18+ Required** - Modern development environment needed

- **Build System** - Complete change from Gulp to Vite

2. **Install Dependencies** - `npm install` with Node.js 18+
3. **Review New Structure** - Familiarize with `src-modern/` organization
4. **Migrate Customizations** - Port themes and custom code
5. **Test Functionality** - Verify all features work as expected
6. **Deploy New Version** - Use `npm run build` for production
